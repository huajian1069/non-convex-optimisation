## Introduction
A mathematical optimisation problem has the general form 

<div align="center"> 
  $minimize$ $f_0(x)$ 
  
  $subject$ $to$ $f_i(x) \leq b_i, i=1, ..., m.$
</div>

One relative simple case with nice property is called convex optimisation problem, in which the objective and constraint functions are convex, which means they satisfy the inequality

<div align="center"> 
$\[ f_i(\alpha x + \beta y) \leq \alpha f_i(x) + \beta f_i(y), i=0, ..., m. \]$
</div> 
  
With $\alpha + \beta = 1, \alpha, \beta \geq 0$. Notice, the linear programming is a special case of convex optimisation: equality replaces the more general inequality.

Nevertheless, in the state of art application of computer vision, researcher begin to investigate Geometric Deep Learning, i.e., learning a representation of 3D mesh in a latent code space(like 256 dimension). How to optimise this problem is a non-convex optimisation problem. 


In this project, I work on improving a global optimisation method-covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy(CMA-ES) by exploiting **differentiablity**. In short, CMA-ES is very likely the most successful evolution stragety, with solid mathematics foundation. But it ignore the information of gradient, this is a pity in above optimisation problem. 

My stragety is to inject an inner optimiser into CMA-ES. Here is the demo of results when using this new optimiser on Ackley benchmark function.
Throughout all the semester, I tested several off-the-shelf optimiser and my proposed composite optimiser on BENCHMARK functions(like Ackley), rather than real computer vision problems.

If you are interested, please refer to my report and presentation slides. By now, this semester project has been completed. But I will continue to extend the optimiser to be applied on a real 3D mesh reconstruction/shape optimisation problem in the summer as an intern or RA in the lab. This will be a real world computer vision challenge, called MeshSDF[4], a very recent work submitted at June 2020.
